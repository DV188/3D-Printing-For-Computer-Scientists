<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to 3D Printing for Computer Scientists!  This document serves as a guide for individuals with programming experience who are interested in three dimensional modelling as it pertains to 3D printing.  Readers are not expected to have any formal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">computer-aided design</a> (CAD) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing"a>computer-aided manufacturing</a> (CAM) experience.  No former knowledge of 3D printing is required either.  It is expected that a basic understanding of programming concepts has been learned, any programming experience will do.</p>

<h3>OpenSCAD</h3>

<p>This guide will begin with the creation of three dimensional models.  These models will be created using a specially designed programming language, <a href="http://www.openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a>.  OpenSCAD provides an environment where the programmer can write detailed code that can then be processed into a three dimensional image similar to what they would design using a CAD software package.  A majority of the built in functions OpenSCAD provides will be detailed with code examples.  The programmatic approach to three dimensional modelling will hopefully interest individuals with previous programming experience.  Most of the functionality OpenSCAD offers will feel intuitive to any student or graduate with computer science as a background.</p>

<h3>Stereolithography</h3>

<p>The predominant file type used to save three dimensional models should be made familiar to a computer scientists.  A look into the makings of the file format and how it integrates with the rest of the 3D printing tool chain can be found in <a href="#/stereolithography">this</a> section.</p>
