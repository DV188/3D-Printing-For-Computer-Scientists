<h1>OpenSCAD</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">computer-aided design</a> (CAD) software package that allows the user to design three dimensional models using common programming techniques and syntax.  OpenSCAD is available for Linux/Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X for free released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">General Public License version 2</a>.  This software uses combinations of geometric primitives to create models using a technique known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry">constructive solid geometry</a> (CSG).<p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>To install the OpenSCAD application, simply download the application by following the instructions that apply to your operating system.  Follow this link to go directly to the OpenSCAD download page, <a href="http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html">www.openscad.org/downloads</a>.  The source code is also available and can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad">OpenSCAD github page</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have the program downloaded and installed, open OpenSCAD to get started. As the software opens for the first time, a splash screen with some quick start options will be displayed:</p>

<p>Selecting the new button will open the program to begin modeling.  Welcome to OpenSCAD!  On the left of your screen is the text editor where we will write code to be converted into our three dimensional model.  On the right hand side of the screen, a preview window of our model sits on top of the console window.</p>

<p>The editor has some standard buttons placed along the top of the window for new, open, and save file, as well as undo, redo, and indentation control.  You will also notice a button for both preview and render.  The buttons will be used similar to the <i>run</i> button found in a typical integrated development environment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>).  The last button is the export <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">STL</a> button for saving your designs in a typical format read by your slicer software (more on the slicer later).</p>

<p>The buttons below the view port, on the right, are all there to manipulate the view of your model to your liking.  The console acts like a debug window in your favourite IDE.  Here, hints as to what went wrong in your code is display as well as standard output.</p>
